# NASA-APOD

Using HTML, CSS and JS to call NASA's Astronomy Photo of the Day API

## Set up instructions

If using `git clone`, please undertake the following updates to make sure this works on your local machine:
- update config copy.js to __config.js__
- obtain your personal API key from NASA (here)[https://api.nasa.gov/]
- update the config file with your API key
- launching the HTML file in the browser should then show the various Astronomy Picture of the Day posts.

## Future updates

- update to allow for video media as well as images (currently only handles images)
- background grid remains static and content scrolls on top
